Display Figma files using an Embed block.

== Description ==

* Embed a Figma file using a block in the WordPress editor.
* Paste a Figma URL on a new line in the Block Editor to automatically convert it to a Figma Embed block.
* Block settings allow for altering margins of rendered Figma file embed

== Screenshots ==

1. The Figma Embed block with sample URL pre-embed.
2. The rendered Figma Embed block in the editor / admin.
3. The Figma Embed block settings prior to rendering in the editor / admin.
4. Front-end rendering of the Figma Embed block.

== Getting Started ==

Once the plugin is installed and activated, you should see a new Figma Embed block. Insert this block into your content and enter the URL of the Figma file you want to embed.

Assuming it's a valid URL, the block will automatically fetch the Figma file and display it in the editor. Once saved, this will also display on the front-end.
