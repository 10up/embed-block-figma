== Getting Started ==

Once the plugin is installed and activated, you should see a new Figma Embed block. Insert this block into your content and enter the URL of the Figma file you want to embed.

Assuming it's a valid URL, the block will automatically fetch the Figma file and display it in the editor. Once saved, this will also display on the front-end.
